Remaining tasks:

[x] Test #content change (-> main_template) and port to Plone proper if sensible (at least trunk)

[x] Fix nav tree CSS
[x] Consolidate Splash and Sidebar CSS
[x] fix pane CSS so it doesn't have expand/collapse by default
[x] Add Plone icon instead of "Home"
[ ] Make the inputLabel JS in Plone capable of inserting type="search" on search boxes, so we can keep valid HTML (JS from Martijn)
[ ] Add tile JS and classes (JS from Martijn)
[x] Fix login/join/logout pages
[ ] Fix plone_control_panel
[x] Fix dashboard (#region-content?)
[ ] Make a first draft of the Support page
[ ] Print CSS
[x] Sprites for images, possibly inverted arrow for colors
[ ] Convert CSS to shorthand properties
[ ] Remove all color profiles
[x] Fix batch navigation (previous/next)

Right before launch:
[x] Get feeds.plone.org CNAME added, move main 4 RSS feeds to Feedburner
[ ] Meet with Iain, make sure all the colors are correct and have no color profiles.
[ ] Check that site doesn't totally break in IE6, have Denis assist here.
[ ] Check that site looks OK in Ubuntu + Firefox
[ ] Minimize HTTP requests and check cache headers
[ ] Make sure JS and CSS is minified (YUI Compressor does a good job on CSS), and that it's all zip packed.
[ ] Make sure all the JS is combined into a single file served up by Plone
[ ] Get comparison stats (KB/HTTP req) from old vs. new for announcement

Shortly after launch (can be prepared up front):

[ ] Planet Plone version
[ ] Nabble version
[ ] Mibbit color scheme/font

Nice-to-have template tasks (not critical for release):

[ ] Pulldown JS/CSS for user profile (Site setup + logout goes here) and version selectors for PSC/PHC.
[ ] Backport the #region-content fixes to Plone 3.3, should be in main_template
[ ] Backport anything useful from custom folder + portal_view_customizations
[x] Add in FancyZoom (jQ version) to replace screenshot fullscreen view in PSC
[ ] LiveSearch CSS
[ ] Mail Tarek & co about missing icons in the PSC pref panes
[ ] Some of the control panel templates have duplicate content, prefs_user_details is one. Backport.
[ ] Consider alternate arrows for the accordion. &#9656; &#9654; &#9655; are options.
