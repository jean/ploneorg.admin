Deliverance bugs:

- inserts xmlns="" on every node
- Escapes comment tags, example:

<style type="text/css" media="screen">
   <!-- 
   @import url(http://localhost:5000//member-cachekey9098.css); 
   -->
</style>

becomes:

<style xmlns="" type="text/css" media="screen">
   &lt;!-- 
   @import url(http://localhost:5000//member-cachekey9098.css); 
   --&gt;
</style>

The rule used in this case is:

<append content='/html/head/style' theme='/html/head' />


Theming guidelines:
- Put the CSS in Plone, since Kupu and other components need to know that it exists (You can still have static versions in the Deliverance file, but use "replace" to overwrite them) - actually, this seems to not be true, as Kupu will pull out the <head> tag from whatever is served up. The problem right now is that Deliverance kills the body tag from the original, and hence doesn't get the #content ID that enables proper body text display.
