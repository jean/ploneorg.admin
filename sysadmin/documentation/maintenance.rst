Maintenance
===========

Occasionally, things like software upgrades and hardware replacment must occur 
on plone.org. 

Procedure
---------

To facilitate this process, we generally try to schedule maintenance
windows at least one week in advance.

If you are a member of the admin's team, and you are considering an action that 
will require plone.org downtime (i.e. outage of any plone.org :doc:`service </services>`), please
create a news item on plone.org (e.g. http://plone.org/plone.org-upgrade-coming) 
and submit it for publication.

After submitting, please notify someone with publishing-ability in `#plone`_ and ask
them to review/publish it. E.g. limi, baekholt, jonstahl.
