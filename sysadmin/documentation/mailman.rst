Mailman 
=======

These are the details of the Mailman service running on aneka.plone.org (CNAME lists.plone.org).

Mailman
-------

Specs
~~~~~

- Version = 2.1.6 (source build) 
- Location = /srv/lists.plone.org/mailman
- Path = /Applications/mailman (symlinked Applications = /srv/lists.plone.org)

Notes
~~~~~

Mailman was built from source due to the need to pass selected parameters on install. The original location on dues was copied on the aneka install and on the original the libs and archives where symlinked as well, the newer install uses the same method symlinking from the server release location to /Applications/mailman/archives/

The path is /Applications symlinked as that was what was most convenient to use at the time due to the person migrating it using that path on there own system.

Postfix
-------

Specs
~~~~~

- Postfix: Version = 2.3.8 
- Location = /usr/lib/postfix 
- relay domains = lists.plone.org 
- Allowed domains = aneka.plone.org, localhost.plone.org, localhost
- Spamassassin: Version = 3.2.3 
- Perl version = 5.8.8

Notes
~~~~~

Spamassassin is using Bayes system rules with a current score of 5.0 â€“ at the moment it delivers the mail marked as spam so a judgement can be made on if it is spam or not until a good balance in terms of scoring has been found, they can then be temporarily stored in a separate mailbox or discarded automatically.
