SSL Certificate
===============

The Plone Foundation has a wildcard SSL certificate
for \*.plone.org. This is currently used via apache2
on dev.plone.org and svn.plone.org.

The certificate and key files are at
/srv/deus.plone.org/etc/ssl . Please exercise all
care in handling of the key file: it should be treated as a secret, 
highly confidential and protected from unintended disclosure.
