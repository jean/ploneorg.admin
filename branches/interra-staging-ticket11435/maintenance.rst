Maintenance
===========

Occasionally, things like software upgrades and hardware replacement must occur 
on plone.org services.

Basic procedure
---------------

To facilitate this process:

- We generally try to schedule maintenance windows at least **one week in advance**.

- If you are a member of the admin's team, and you are considering an action that will require plone.org downtime (i.e. outage of any plone.org :doc:`service </services>`), please **create a news item** on plone.org (e.g. http://plone.org/plone.org-upgrade-coming) and submit it for publication.

- After submitting, please **notify someone** with publishing-ability in `#plone`_ and ask them to review/publish it. E.g. limi, baekholt, jonstahl.

Additional steps
----------------

In addition, if the service is plone.org **please send email** to support at sixfeetup
dot com before you begin so they can remove the service from their monitoring system
(otherwise their folks will get paged and show up in #plone.org asking what
is going on :-)).
