Transition Notes
================

On deus, the old planet feeds are configured in config.ini.

On deus2, they're in feeds.cfg.

When updating feeds, please update both files, until the transition to deus2
is complete.  Once that's done, remove config.ini from the repository, and use
feeds.cfg exclusively.
